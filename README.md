The Digital Impact Alliance (https://dial.global, DIAL), current steward organization of the Principles for Digital Development (https://digitalprinciples.org, 'The Principles'), has pulled the basic image assets from The Principles website in a location and format that is quick and easy to find and download.

It's unclear if this is part of the trend of moving DIAL's products towards a more proprietary and license-based structure, or just inepitude.

The motivation is less important than the violation of the principles themselves, ironically by the steward organization ("Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation").

This download package is meant as a replacement for previously-available assets from The Principles website, in case further privatization takes place. This download package is licensed under creative commons per the original purview of The Principles, unless legal cease-and-desist action is taken.
